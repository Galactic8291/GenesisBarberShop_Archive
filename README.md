  UPDATE: So in the meantime I have moved to a new repository. The owner of the shop enjoys what I have so far so I'm gonna do everything in my power to get this project to be better. Also I messed up in branching and I wanted to but I want you guys to know this is a process. The projects repos are recreated not to completely dump everything but to enchance my development cycle. So yeah till next time.
